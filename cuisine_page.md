## Cuisine
**Project description:** A simple mockup UI for an imaginary Cuisine application. The mockup is made in Figma and interfaces are based on requirements and use cases in the system proposal and system design documentation. Below are few examples from the mockup. The idea of this application came from the very famous Bon Appetit YouTube Channel. I kept the UI design as simple as possbile without the neglecting the importance of user experience and used a theme of colours throughout the mockup.
