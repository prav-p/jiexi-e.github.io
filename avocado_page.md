## Avocado Price Analysis
**Goal:** To gain a deeper business understanding by using analytical and problem solving skills along with analytical tools such as Tableau, and RapidMiner on real life situations.

**Project description:** A Analysis on avocado prices for the year 2020 based on a avocado dataset provided by Kaggle.
This is a team project which consist of 3 team members, Aaron Lumpkin, Amanda Young and Pravitha Pratheep. We all had our own roles and 
I took on the role to carry out Data Modeling with RapidMiner to identify predictors to predict the target variable, prices of avocado. Our target audience was farmers and we wanted to help them gain more profits on selling avocados.

**Outcome**: We identified certain variables such as time, type and region that were affecting the fluctuating prices of avocados across the United States. These variables were then use to predict the future prices of avocados for the year 2020.
