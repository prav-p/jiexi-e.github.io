## Basket
**Goal:** As a senior, I have teamed up with four other classmates for my senior capstone project to develop a MVP that will launch early June 2021. The snapshots below
          are the user interface of the grocery delivery application, Basket. 
          
**Reason:** Why did we decide to develop another grocery delivery application? With the COVID-19 pandemic that occured back in 2020 and is still ongoing, many mom and pop shops 
            in the King County region suffered tremendously as they are small businesses. We came up with the idea of developing this application in order to provide a platform
            for them to carry out their businesses online. The application only focuses on small businessess rather than big corporate companies like Target ,QFC or Safeway.
            In addition, with the government advising people to social distance, mom and pop shops are usually small and compact, not providing much space for customers to social distance. With a delivery platform catered for small grocery stores, they are able to maintain their businesses.  
            
**Outcome:** With that in mind, I designed the prototype of Basket, which will be implemented in the MVP for launching in June 2021. I do not have much experience in Figma but I
              I gained them as I went on designing the prototype with the focus of ensuring the satisfaction of the users. After carrying out SWOT analysis, I decided to use orange as the main colour of the app rather than green that is widely used in other grocery applications. Orange represents warmth and satisfaction, mom and pop shops always provided the welcoming feeling.
