  Hello there, you've landed on my portfolio. I'm Pravitha sometimes known as Jie Xi and I'm from Penang, Malaysia. 
  <br><br>
  A first generation college student majoring in Information Systems at Seattle Pacific University
  with an expected graduation date of June 2021 and seeking full-time or volunteer or internship opportunities for Summer/Fall 2021!
  <br><br>
  I have a keen interest on UX/UI and analytics. I believe these two fields go hand in hand to understand end users
  in order to produce a considerate, emphatic and humanistic design.
  I am knowledgable and have hands-on experience in C++,Java,JavaScript,Python and also the project management tool , JIRA.
