## Cuisine
**Goal:** To have an understanding and experience to write up a system design documentation which included Project Initiation Request, System Proposal and System Specifications.

**Project description:** A simple mockup UI for an imaginary Cuisine application. The mockup is made in Figma and interfaces are based on requirements and use cases in the system proposal and system design documentation. Below are few examples from the mockup and also an architecture overview. The idea of this application came from the very famous Bon Appetit YouTube Channel.

**Outcome**: Achieved a simple mockup for the application along with a well planned system specification.
