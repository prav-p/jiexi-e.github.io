## AWS Certified Developer - Associate
**Project description:** Last Summer 2020 , like many others I was unable to obtain an internship. I decided to take up the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified Developer - Associate certification. In order to prepare for the certification, I went through multiple resources such as courses on Udemy, watching YouTube videos provided by freecodecamp, read white papers provided by AWS. The preparation took me approximately 3 months and I scheduled the proctored examination on December 18 2020 where I took it at home. 

**Outcome:** The examination tested candidates on 5 domains which are : **Deployment, Security,Development with AWS services,Refactoring and lastly Monitoring and Troubleshooting.** From this experience I learned how to develop, deploy, and debug cloud-based applications that follow AWS best practices. In addition, I've gained knowledge and understanding on application life-cycle managment. I achieved a score of ***867 out 1000*** with the passing mark at 720.
